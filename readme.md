### Joy of Coding conference 2013 iOS app

This application provides the session schedule and a geo-fence 'check in' function for the Joy of Coding conference in Rotterdam, held on March 1st, 2013. 

[Joy of Coding](http://joyofcoding.org/) is a one-day conference that celebrates the art, craft, science, but foremost the joy of software development. 

Fill in your Twitter handle in the 'check in'-field to allow the application to monitor your location. You will be 
automatically checked in when you arrive at the conference venue. A projector will be used during the conference to display Twitter avatars of those checked in at the conference at the given time.
